# How to Tackle recursion problems and Thinking: 

### Important steps to consider: 

In recursion, determining what to return for the base case is a crucial step in designing a recursive algorithm. The base case defines the condition under which the recursion should stop and provides the result that the recursive function returns when that condition is met. Here's how you can understand what to return for the base case:

1. Identify the problem: First, clearly understand the problem you're trying to solve using recursion. Break it down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. Understanding the problem's requirements and constraints is essential.
2. Define the base case: The base case is the simplest scenario where you can directly compute the result without making any further recursive calls. It acts as the exit condition for your recursive function. Ask yourself, "What is the smallest, simplest, or most basic input for this problem?" The answer to this question often helps you determine what to return in the base case.
3. Return a value or result: In the base case, you should return a value that represents the solution for that specific simple scenario. This value should be directly calculable without any further recursive calls. It might be a constant, a specific value, or a result from a simple calculation.
4. Consider the recursive cases: Once you've defined the base case, focus on the recursive cases, which are the situations where your function calls itself with modified inputs to solve larger instances of the problem. When you make a recursive call in the non-base cases, trust that the recursive function will correctly handle those cases and return the appropriate results.
5. Ensure progress towards the base case: In each recursive call, make sure you're moving closer to the base case. If you don't do this, your recursion might result in an infinite loop or stack overflow. Ensure that the input to the recursive function is getting smaller, simpler, or closer to the base case with each recursive call.


### Components of Recursion:  (3 Laws)

1. A recursive algorithm must have a  **base case** .
2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.
3. A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.
